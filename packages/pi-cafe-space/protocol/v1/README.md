# Frozen wire v1 baseline (R02)

Source baseline: `cf20beaf65097173b78a632a79df615b9576e5ce`, captured 2026-09-18 UTC before changing any runtime implementation. Sources are `src/protocol/index.ts`, `src/relay/server.ts`, `src/extension/{index,file-commands}.ts`, and `web/public/app.js`. Source digests and exact limits are in [limits.json](./limits.json). JSON differences are specified in [compatibility.md](./compatibility.md).

Fixtures are synthetic, contain no user session data, and are expectations derived from the unchanged TS source, then executed against it. Go must consume the same checked-in expectations, never regenerate them from its own output. Ordered parts are **not** part of this baseline; R12 adds a separate corpus.

## Field notation and direction

`S(n)` = nonempty string of at most n UTF-16 code units; `E(n)` = string including empty; `N(n)` = null or E(n). `?` = optional/absent, **not** nullable unless explicitly stated. Booleans must be JSON booleans, numbers cannot be strings. Fields below are required unless `?`. Unknown fields are accepted then discarded at known wire/schema levels, but retained within bounded result `data`.

Every frame is a JSON text message ≤262144 UTF-8 bytes (including whitespace and escaped JSON). No binary, compression or model transport. A decoded message alone does not authorize a role, room or command.

| type | Fields after `type` | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hello | protocolVersion=1, peerRole=host/client, peerId:S(128), roomId:S(128), token:S(4096) | either peer → relay, first message only |
| welcome | protocolVersion=1, connectionId:S(128), peerRole, roomId:S(128), hostConnected:bool | relay → peer |
| host_status | connected:bool, streamId:N(128), sessionId:N(256), hostId?:N(128), hosts?:HostInfo[≤64] | relay → client |
| snapshot | hostId?:S(128), snapshot:SessionSnapshot | host → relay → clients |
| event | hostId?:S(128), streamId:S(128), sessionId:S(256), seq:integer 0..1000000000, emittedAt:S(64), event:CollabEvent | host → relay → clients |
| command | requestId:S(128), expectedStreamId:S(128), expectedSessionId?:S(256), expectedCwd?:S(16384), targetHostId?:S(128), payload:CommandPayload | client → relay |
| routed_command | relayRequestId:S(128), clientRequestId:S(128), sourcePeerId:S(128), expectedStreamId:S(128), expectedSessionId?:S(256), expectedCwd?:S(16384), targetHostId?:S(128), payload | relay → selected host |
| host_command_result | relayRequestId:S(128), status, code:N(128), message:N(2048), data?:bounded JSON | host → relay |
| command_result | hostId?:S(128), requestId:S(128), status, code:N(128), message:N(2048), data?:bounded JSON | relay → originating client connection |
| error | code:S(128), message:S(2048) | relay → peer |

`status = dispatched | applied | rejected`. `dispatched/REQUEST_PENDING` is nonfinal; other dispatched results acknowledge dispatch, not completion of a model run. Relay replaces host-supplied hostId with authenticated identity. Production room ID is stricter than codec: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{0,63}$/`, no surrounding whitespace.

### Nested schemas

- ModelRef: null or `{provider:S(128), id:S(256)}`.
- TranscriptMessage: `{id:S(128), role:user|assistant|tool|system, text:E(65536), thinking:E(65536), timestamp:finite number, status:streaming|complete|error, toolName:N(256), toolCallId:N(256)}`. Negative/fractional timestamp is currently valid; not necessarily an ISO/date range.
- ToolExecution: `{toolCallId:S(256), toolName:S(256), argsText:E(65536), output:E(65536), status:running|complete|error}`.
- HostInfo: `{hostId:S(128), connected:bool, ready?:bool, streamId:N(128), sessionId:N(256), sessionName:N(256), cwd:N(16384)}`. Missing ready is legacy, not false.
- SessionSnapshot: `{protocolVersion:1, streamId:S(128), sessionId:S(256), sessionName:N(256), cwd:E(16384), activeLeafId:N(128), model:ModelRef, thinkingLevel, phase, hasPendingMessages:bool, messages:TranscriptMessage[≤1000], historyTruncated?:bool, tools:ToolExecution[≤500], lastEventSeq:integer 0..1000000000}`. Canonicalization fills absent historyTruncated=false.
- thinkingLevel: off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max. phase: idle|running|waiting_local_ui.

### All eight commands

| name | Additional fields |
| --- | --- |
| prompt | content:S(65536), delivery?:steer|followUp |
| abort | none |
| set_thinking | level:thinkingLevel |
| set_model | provider:S(128), modelId:S(256) |
| list_dir | path:E(4096) |
| read_file | path:E(4096), offset?:integer 0..100000000, limit?:integer 1..262144 |
| list_sessions | none |
| get_session | sessionId:S(256) |

Path validation and authorized project access happen in the extension, not the relay. A wire-valid path can still be rejected for security. read_file producer clamps actual bytes to 131072; wire limit is not its actual read size.

### All eleven events

| kind | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| session_state | phase, hasPendingMessages:bool |
| message_started / message_finished | message:TranscriptMessage |
| message_delta | messageId:S(128), channel:text|thinking, delta:E(65536) |
| tool_started / tool_finished | tool:ToolExecution |
| tool_updated | toolCallId:S(256), output:E(65536) |
| model_changed | model:ModelRef |
| thinking_changed | level:thinkingLevel |
| ui_wait | waiting:bool, title:N(512) |
| notice | level:info|warning|error, message:S(16384) |

Reducer first checks matching stream/session and exactly lastEventSeq+1. Message/tool upserts replace by real ID; deltas append to the chosen channel, tool_updated **replaces** output. Missing nonempty message delta marks truncation; missing empty message delta does not; missing tool_updated always marks truncation. ui_wait(false) selects running, not idle. notice only advances seq. Eviction/cropping marks historyTruncated. Pure reducer bounds and Relay snapshot compaction bounds are intentionally different.

## Relay state and failures

Client authentication outputs welcome → host_status → retained ready/offline snapshots (host insertion order). Host authentication sends welcome and publishes online/not-ready status to clients. Snapshot publishes snapshot → ready status. Same-context snapshot seq must not decrease. Duplicate/gapped/wrong-context event clears readiness, sends EVENT_SEQUENCE, closes host 1011 and publishes offline status; no event is silently skipped.

Dedupe key is JSON tuple `[peerId, requestId]`, per host. Route selection considers explicit target, then unique pending/result owner, then matching stream/session; ambiguous owners reject HOST_SELECTION_REQUIRED. Readiness is checked before retained snapshot fences, then stream/session/cwd fences before dedupe/cache. Stale fences send a rejection then a current snapshot. A same-peer browser reconnect can explicitly retry pending ID to transfer result delivery to its new connection; without retry, late reply must not go to that new socket. Host replacement rejects pending HOST_REPLACED and invalidates caches; old close/result cannot affect the replacement.

Only actual list_sessions/get_session requests populate offline history cache. get result must have matching sessionId and kind=session; list requires kind=sessions. Codec validates bounded JSON, Relay validates this minimum association, browser must validate complete result shape. Projection-changing events/snapshots invalidate history and fence pending reads; phase-only events do not. Offline history hits refresh both history and offline-host inactivity timers; file/write requests cannot use offline history cache.

Errors fixed by source/trace assertions include INVALID_MESSAGE, BINARY_UNSUPPORTED, HELLO_REQUIRED, INVALID_ROOM, UNAUTHORIZED, ROOM_LIMIT, CLIENT_LIMIT, HOST_LIMIT, STALE_HOST, STALE_CLIENT, ROLE_VIOLATION, SNAPSHOT_REQUIRED, STALE_SNAPSHOT, EVENT_SEQUENCE, INTERNAL_ERROR; command codes include HOST_NOT_FOUND, HOST_SELECTION_REQUIRED, HOST_OFFLINE, HOST_NOT_READY, STALE_STREAM, STALE_SESSION, REQUEST_PENDING, COMMAND_QUEUE_FULL, COMMAND_TOO_LARGE, HOST_TIMEOUT, HOST_REPLACED, HOST_EXPIRED, RESULT_INVALID, RESULT_TOO_LARGE. Extension errors are forwarded (e.g. PATH_NOT_ALLOWED, SENSITIVE_PATH, BINARY_FILE, SESSION_INVALID). Error code is a bounded string, not a closed enum allowing only this list.

Close codes: normal replacement 1000; shutdown 1001; binary 1003; malformed raw UTF-8 from ws 1007; invalid JSON/auth/hello/timeout 1008; oversized raw frame 1009; seq/snapshot/internal/send failure 1011; capacity/backpressure 1013. Per-socket close backstop is 1000ms. See fixtures for precise reason strings and required per-recipient output order.

## Portable fixture format and runner

Run in package: `npm.cmd run refactor:contracts:test`. Existing `npm.cmd run pi-cafe-space:test` from repo also includes this suite. Tests use only freshly bound loopback port 0 and synthetic credentials, and terminate only their own sockets/listener in finally.

- `../fixtures/v1/codec.json`: decode inputText OR inputBase64 OR inputTemplate; expected accepted/value or code. inputBase64 tests raw byte boundary with fatal UTF-8 decoding. `paddingBytes` right-pads JSON with ASCII spaces to exact byte size.
- `reducer.json`: operation=applyEvent, snapshot/envelope, exact expected output or error message. Inputs may be reducer-only in-memory boundary values, not necessarily valid wire frames.
- `budgets.json`: fitCommandResult input plus exact expected output; encode is the TS canonical decode + JSON.stringify outbound baseline (TS has no public EncodeWire function).
- `values.json`: shared immutable templates. `$ref` refers to a named template, or to a previously bound trace ID; `$merge` shallow-merges expanded objects; `$repeat:{text,count}`, `$array:{value,count}`, `$object:{value,count}` (keys k0..kN), `$nest:{value,depth}` generate bounded boundary inputs. These tags are fixture-only and never protocol fields. Template operator objects have exactly one key.
- `traces/*.json`: connect uses a unique label per socket generation; send/receive carry message templates; close/expectClose assert peer close; advance moves application timeout clock in milliseconds. Every receive compares the next FIFO message, including all keys. `$bind` captures a fresh UUID once; `$ref` reuses it thereafter. No dropping IDs or unordered subset matching. Socket listeners are registered at construction before sending; FIFO retains arrivals before the next receive step. Final ping/pong barriers then assert no extra queued messages.
- Runtime timers are fake only for deterministic traces; assertion deadlines and I/O remain real. Golden tests never run a model or access Pi JSONL.

## Coverage and remaining layers

All ten wire variants, eight commands, eleven events, required/null/unknown fields, UTF-16 vs bytes, exact raw/result budgets, duplicate keys, raw invalid UTF-8/BOM, surrogate/number behavior, bounded result graph, sequence/reducer behavior are executable fixtures. Traces cover auth/role/binary, hello/snapshot timeouts, host replacement, client generations, multi-host ambiguity, room isolation, cwd fence, stale snapshot/event, pending/result dedupe, result association, history poisoning/revision/offline inactivity and command timeout.

Nonportable JS getter/proxy/cycle/prototype/Map regression tests remain in `src/protocol/index.test.ts`; source paths and further existing security regressions are mapped in limits.json. Filesystem, process ownership, HTTP static path/Origin tests stay in their existing suites and later Go transport/HTTP tests; pure fixtures do not pretend to test OS behavior. New Go global quotas are CONTRACTS additions, not old TS constants.
